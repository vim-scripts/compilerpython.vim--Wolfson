Based on the script and notation from vimscript #1439. This has been updated for the newer format of py_compile.

From the original description:
"This compiler script does not run the source through the python interpreter, but instead uses the py_compile package to check for syntax errors.  This allows for a development cycle similar to a compiled language - edit, compile, run."
